      <h2>Ogbeide Osarieme: "I think Square shaped nails are better than Almond shaped nails"</h2>

      <p>
      <b>Classic and Timeless:</b>

       Square nails have been a classic nail shape for years and continue to be a popular choice. <br>
       They offer a timeless and elegant look that complements various styles and outfits. <br>
 
      </p>

       <p>
      <b>Durability:</b>

      Square nails have a flat edge that is less likely to break or chip compared to almond nails,  <br>
      which have a pointed tip. This makes square nails a practical choice for individuals with  <br>
      an active lifestyle.
      </p>

      <p>
    <b>Versatility:</b>

      Square nails provide a flat surface, making it easier to apply nail polish or nail art. <br>
      They allow for a variety of designs and colors, enhancing creativity and self-expression. <br>
     
     </p>

      <p>
    <b>Low Maintenance:</b>

      Square nails are generally easier to maintain since they don't require as much reshaping or filing as almond nails. <br>
      This saves time and effort for those with a busy schedule. <br>

      <h2>Katrina MacAdams: "Square shaped nails are ugly. Almond is totally better... no offence."</h2>

      <b>Aesthetic:</b>

      Almond nails are considered more elegant and graceful than square nails. <br>
      The curved shape of almond nails can make fingers appear longer and more delicate, adding a touch of sophistication to one's overall appearance. <br>

     </p>

      <p>
     <b>Comfort:</b>

     Almond nails are more comfortable to wear because of their natural shape, which aligns better with the shape of the fingertips.  <br>
     Square nails feel bulkier and less ergonomic.   <br>
    
     </p>

     <p>


   <b>Current Fashion Trends:</b>

   Almond nails have gained popularity in recent fashion trends,  <br>
   making them the preferred choice for many individuals who want to stay in vogue.<br>
    
    </p>

    <b>More Natural:</b>

    The amount of times I've been asked if my almond nails were real  <br>
    is enough to make the arguement that they look waymore natural than square! I mean who asks someone with square nails that?.<br>

     <p> Thank you for reading the debate, what shape of nail do you prefer?</p>
