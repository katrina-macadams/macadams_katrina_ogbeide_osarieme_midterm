      <h2>Ogbeide Osarieme: "I think Square shaped nails are better than Almond shaped nails"</h2>

      <p>
      <b>Classic and Timeless:</b>

       Square nails have been a classic nail shape for years and continue to be a popular choice. <br>
       They offer a timeless and elegant look that complements various styles and outfits. <br>
 
      </p>

       <p>
      <b>Durability:</b>

      Square nails have a flat edge that is less likely to break or chip compared to almond nails,  <br>
      which have a pointed tip. This makes square nails a practical choice for individuals with  <br>
      an active lifestyle.
      </p>

      <p>
    <b>Versatility:</b>

      Square nails provide a flat surface, making it easier to apply nail polish or nail art. <br>
      They allow for a variety of designs and colors, enhancing creativity and self-expression. <br>
     
     </p>

      <p>
    <b>Low Maintenance:</b>

      Square nails are generally easier to maintain since they don't require as much reshaping or filing as almond nails. <br>
      This saves time and effort for those with a busy schedule. <br>
